The Debian Package comment
----------------------------

This is an alpha release only suitable for the adventurous.
However it can read/write hilight, not, freetext annotations
(with a bug affecting how Acrobat shows TeX freetext annotations),
it can modify pdf metadata and has some search capabilities.
